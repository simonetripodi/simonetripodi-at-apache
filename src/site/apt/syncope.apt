Apache Syncope

  {{{http://people.apache.org/~ilgrosso}Francesco Chicchiricco}} and I studied at same
  {{{http://www.di.univaq.it/}Department of Computer Science}} at {{{http://www.univaq.it/}University of L'Aquila}}
  but we never met before we both were involved in the {{{http://cocoon.apache.org/}Apache Cocoon}} project.

  Francesco is also the co-founder of {{{http://www.tirasa.net/}Tirasa}}, a company based in
  {{{http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pescara}Pescara (Abruzzo)}} which mainly developed and maintains an OSS IdM product:
  {{{http://syncope.tirasa.net/}Syncope}}.

  Francesco's inestimable passion for OSS and the ASF brought him and his company on the decision of donating their
  product to the ASF, and I happily and proudly helped them on joining the Incubator.

  Long live to {{{http://incubator.apache.org/syncope/}Apache Syncope}}, the ASL2.0 licensed Idm!!!
